Nevertheless sometimes the character conversion fails for different reasons. Set this parameter to no if you run into problems during data export. If the csv file looks weird and you find text like 'Detected an illegal character in input string', set the parameter to no. When you set the parameter to no the conversion is skipped and export will work correct in most cases. But you have to import the csv file actively into excel then and choose the right character set (usually unicode (UTF-8)) manually."
